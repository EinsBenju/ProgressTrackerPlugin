# ProgressTracker

A BakkesMod plugin to track and visualize your progress in workshop maps.

Let's say you start training a rings map. Maybe you want to see if you make progress over time and complete the map in shorter time and with less deaths. 

Well now you can! 

This plugin allows you to insert your needed time and amount of deaths and save it!

The plugin even let's you track different maps, for example you can submit values for your rings map AND submit values for your dibble map.

But the best part is, not only does the plugin save your times, you can plot it in a beautiful graph and see your progress visualized! 

IMPORTANT:
This plugin is work in progress, so I can't confirm 100% that it won't crash your game and doesn't randomly loose all your progress data, so maybe keep backups. (Data files are stored in "C:/Users/%userprofile%/AppData/Roaming/bakkesmod/bakkesmod/data/ProgressTrackerData/")
Also I never learned or coded with C++, so a lot of code is generated with the help of ChatGPT, so be aware of some inconsitencies in the implementation.

If you have any reccomendations or bugs you can contact me via Disocrd @einsbenju.
